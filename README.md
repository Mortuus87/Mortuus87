## Hi there
I'm a frontend developer. I started my journey into this field due to a wish to simplify my hobby of worldbuilding for virtual tabletop roleplaying games. This has led me into studies and a career in programming and design implementation. 

## Interests
My professional interests lie in making neat and useful web applications. Privately I enjoy all the usual things, like music and good stories in books and movies, but I'm not willing to elaborate any further here, as privacy is another of my values.
